## Rule 1:
* Whenever coding new features, you have to create a new branch for you and push on it. I will check and merge it.

## Rule 2:
* Commmit rules:
Message: "SWW/FolderName - message".

## Rule 3:
* Please don't try to comment every line of code, instead of doing this, try to make your code meaningful.
